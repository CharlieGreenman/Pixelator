Pixelator
=========

A really simple tool to generate one element css box-shadow pixel style.

Live demo: http://lab.elrumordelaluz.com/pixelator/

After made Marty McPixel (http://codepen.io/elrumordelaluz/pen/sHjrF), 
it came to my mind the idea of a possible tool to generate this things without code.
I made something like this little tool I had in mind and here is (a working-progress)...

Up to now it's possible to set the grid and the output pixel size.

I have in mind lot of todos to apply.
I really want to know your comments to improve this tool.
